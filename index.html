    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      Therapy is a brave and vulnerable undertaking. I hold this with the utmost respect as you come
      to me with your needs and longings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that everyone, given the right support, has the capacity to heal. I am humbled and
      motivated by the healing I have thus far witnessed in my career.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will partner with you to create a safe space in which we can together understand and explore
      the dynamics at play in your life. My work is grounded in an understanding of the neurobiology
      of attachment; lasting change happens when you are in a compassionate connection with a safe
      other. Together we will hold and honor that your distress can be understood in the context of
      your life story, some of which was not of your doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will support you in working through your experience in a manageable way, so that you can
      track and feel the changes you are seeking. I believe that the goal of therapy is not just to
      alleviate symptoms, but to live a life of greater enlivenment in the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      My practice takes insurance (BCBS PPO) and offers a sliding fee scale when needed.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have a background in individual outpatient treatment, couples and family work, and treatment
      within the medical setting, including working with parents who have adopted children, and with
      parents during and after their children’s hospitalizations in a neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU).
    </p>
    <p>
      I draw from over 15 years of clinical practice in my treatment approach, and work from an
      integrative model of both relational approaches and body-centered interventions, to provide
      trauma-informed care.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work with clients who struggle with anxiety, racing thoughts, depressed mood, conflict in
      relationships, chronic pain, difficulty regulating in relationship, trouble with intimacy,
      parenting concerns, ambivalence about certain aspects of their lives and more. I specialize in
      the treatment of complex trauma and dissociative disorders.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach to couples work prioritizes helping you foster increased emotional safety within
      your relationship. This can take the form of helping you with your communication style,
      growing your capacity to tolerate and discuss difficult topics, struggles with intimacy,
      parenting, life planning and more. Our work together will be grounded in helping you and your
      partner stay present and regulated enough for meaningful and lasting change.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working with both individuals and couples.

    <h2>Credentials</h2>
    <p>
      I am a graduate of the University of Chicago, Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy and
      Practice (2004) and of Cathedral Counseling Center’s post-graduate psychodynamic fellowship.
      I completed the Level 1 Training for the Treatment of Trauma (2011) and Level II Emotional
      Processing, Meaning Making and Attachment Repair (2018), through the Sensorimotor
      Psychotherapy Institute of Boulder, CO.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been a therapist and trainer at the Chicago Center for Integration and Healing since
      2011.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also a lecturer in the master’s program at the University of Chicago, Crown Family
      School of Social Work
    </p>

  <article class="professionals">
    <h2>For Professionals</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to therapy, I provide clinical consultation to other therapists, developing
      clinicians, and to organizations, helping them integrate trauma-informed, present-oriented,
      and body-centered practices into their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I receive consistent feedback that I am a knowledgeable, relatable and engaging presenter and
      facilitator. I enjoy providing presentations/workshops on many topics, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trauma-informed therapy</li>
      <li>
        Incorporating body-centered techniques into your relational/psychodynamic practice
      </li>
      <li>
        The Power of Presence: self-regulation as one of your greatest tools as a therapist
      </li>
      <li>
        Understanding dissociation: how to track it and what you need to know to ethically treat it
        in your practice
      </li>
      <li>
        Self-regulation and self-soothing: strategies for attuned parenting
      </li>
      <li>
        Mindfulness and self-regulatory capacity in therapy
      </li>
      <li>
        Window of Tolerance: assessment and framing from a trauma-informed treatment approach
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I facilitate Integrated Practices for Healing from Trauma (IP) groups for clients throughout
      the year. These trauma groups focus on understanding the neurobiological effects of trauma,
      traumatic activation and body-centered practice that supports healing. I also offer workshops
      for clinicians looking to understand the work of IP and deepen their own capacities for
      presence through the practices, to provide trauma-informed care.

    <h2>Trauma-Informed Care</h2>
    <p>
      Traumatic events of the past, often live on in the body and mind, and impact the capacity to
      be present to life in a satisfying way. Trauma disrupts central nervous sytem regulation and
      capacity for embodiment. Sometimes folks end up feeling like they are re-experiencing
      something similar to what happened then, as if it’s happening now, even when it isn’t. The
      body has ingenious ways of adapting to overwhelming experience in an attempt to survive; the
      trouble is that in the present, these very strategies that were so helpful back then, often
      have costs that are too big now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trauma treatment is grounded in working in the present moment. It helps folks reconnect to
      their internal experience in safe ways through manageable, modulated work regulating central
      nervous system arousal. Trauma-informed care helps bring folks from functioning in survival
      mode into a life that has room for connection, flexibility, and even joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The therapist’s capacity for compassionate stance and presence in their own body in each
      session is imperative. Trauma-informed care also holds an awareness of power differentials in
      the therapy space, the role of different identities and cultural perspectives, and that
      oppression exists in our society in many forms—including racial trauma, anti-fat culture,
      misogyny and bias and hate toward sexuality and gender. It acknowledges that some folks are
      not safe in the present moment—that trauma can be in one’s past and in one’s present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acknowledging the impact of oppression through the life story is crucial to validating and
      working with the reality that human suffering is most always created by harm from the outside.
      Trauma-informed care holds the entirety of your story, as it is held in your narrative and in
      your body, with exquisite care.

    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
      My practice is grounded in a commitment to ethical mental health treatment across a wide range
      of presenting concerns, with a speciality in the treatment of trauma. This includes an ongoing
      commitment to deconstructing implicitly held biases and acknowledging the impact of systems of
      oppression and the harm and suffering they cause individuals, families and communities. My
      practice seeks to contribute to the growth of a more compassionate humanity, where each of us
      has equitable access to resources (including anti-oppressive mental health treatment) for a
      life of presence with joy.
