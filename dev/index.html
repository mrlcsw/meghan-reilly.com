    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      Therapy is a brave and vulnerable undertaking that I hold with the utmost respect as you come
      to me with your needs and longings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am motivated by the belief that each person, given the right support, has the capacity to
      heal. I am humbled by the healing transformations I routinely witness and experience in my
      career.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will partner with you to create a safe space in which we can together understand and explore
      the dynamics at play in your life. My work is grounded in both an understanding of the the
      neurobiology of attachment and that lasting change that can happen in compassionate connection
      with a safe other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will support you in working through your experience in a manageable way, so that you can
      track and experience the shifts you are seeking. I believe that the goal of therapy is not
      just to reduce symptoms but to live a life of greater enlivenment in the present.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have a background in individual outpatient treatment, couples and family work, and treatment
      within the medical setting, including working with parents who have adopted children, and with
      parents during their children’s hospitalizations in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
    </p>
    <p>
      I draw from over 15 years of clinical practice in my treatment approach, and work from an
      integrative model of both relational approaches and body-centered interventions, to provide
      trauma-informed care.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work with clients who struggle with anxiety, racing thoughts, depressed mood, conflict in
      relationships, chronic pain, difficulty regulating in relationship, trouble with intimacy,
      parenting concerns, ambivalence about certain aspects of their lives and more. I specialize
      in the treatment of complex trauma and dissociative disorders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working with both individuals and couples.
    </p>

    <h2>My Practice</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to therapy, I provide clinical consultation to other therapists, developing
      clinicians, and to organizations, helping them integrate trauma-informed, present-oriented,
      and body-centered practices into their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I receive consistent feedback that I am a knowledgable, relatable and engaging presenter and
      facilitator. I enjoy providing presentations/workshops on many topics, not limited to, but
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trauma-informed therapy</li>
      <li>
        Incorporating body-centered techniques into your relational/psychodynamic practice
      </li>
      <li>
        The power of presence: self-regulatation as one of your greatest tools as a therapist
      </li>
      <li>
        Understanding dissociation: how to track it and what you need to know to ethically treat it
        in your practice
      </li>
      <li>
        Self-regulation and self-soothing (yours not theirs): strategies for attuned parenting
      </li>
      <li>
        Mindfulness and self-regulatory capacity in therapy
      </li>
      <li>
        Window of Tolerance: assessment and framing from a trauma-informed treatment approach
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I facilitate Integrated Practices for Healing from Trauma (IP) groups for clients throughout
      the year. These trauma groups focus on understanding the neurobiological effects of trauma,
      traumatic activation and body-centered practice that supports healing. I also offer workshops
      for clinicians looking to understand the work of IP and deepen their own capacities for
      presence through the practices, to provide trauma-informed care.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a graduate of the University of Chicago, Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy and
      Practice (2004) and of Cathedral Counseling Center’s post-graduate psychodynamic fellowship. I
      completed the Level 1 Training for the Treatment of Trauma (2011) and Level II Emotional
      Processing, Meaning Making and Attachment Repair (2018), through the Sensorimotor
      Psychotherapy Institute of Boulder, CO.

    <h2>Trauma-Informed Care</h2>
    <p>
      Traumatic events of the past often get stuck in "trauma time" in the body and mind, and folks
      end up feeling like they are re-experienceing what happened then, as if it's happening now.
      The body has ingenious ways of adapting to overwhelming experience in an attempt to survive;
      the trouble is that in the present, these very strategies that were so helpful back then,
      often have costs that are too big now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trauma treatment is grounded in working in the present, in helping folks reconnect to their
      inner experience in safe ways, and in building a life that has flexibility and room for
      connection, creativity, and even joy. Trauma treatment will work to help bring folks from
      functioning in survival mode and into a life where they can thrive.
    </p>

    <h2>Values-Based Care</h2>
    <p>
      My professional commitment is to ongoing exploration of body-centered integration and
      mindfulness work in the ethical treatment of trauma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionally and personally I am committed to a process of deconstructing my own implicit
      biases and internalized racism. I support the dismantling of systems of oppression toward a
      more compassionate humanity, where each of us has equitable access to shared resource
      (including anti-oppressive mental health treatment) for a life of presence with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My practice takes insurance (BCBS PPO and BCBS Blue Choice) and offers a sliding fee scale
      when needed.
